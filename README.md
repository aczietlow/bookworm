# Add to Bookshef

Building out an API to fetch the data about books that get suggested to me to read.

Ultimate goal is send a title of a book to the api, and have it add it to my website. But that will require setting up microformats.

## Examples

Start with the open library api.

start with the latest recommendations
- How to Measure Anything: Finding the Value of "Intangibles" in Business (Douglas  Hubbard)
- Supercommunicators: How to Unlock the Secret Language of Connection (Charlest Dugg)
